In the dawn of 2020 Kotawaringin Timur's mayoral race, an innovation was needed to highlight the best of the candidate's vision and his best programs to showcase in then upcoming election. I was tasked by the campaign team to build a web app for that purpose.

## Features

## Technologies Used

This web app is built as a full AMP website, therefore incorporating some of AMP-exclusive components, such as `amp-img`, `amp-carousel`,  `amp-sidebar`, and more. As the result, the website loading is super fast and even faster with AMP websites automatically cached with Google's AMP Cache.

Generated with Eleventy, a simple Javascript-based static site generator.
