When I was in middle school, I played with cool Blogger themes, fiddling with WordPress, and exploring [AuraCMS](https://github.com/auracms/AuraCMS), a local-made CMS. Today, I built modern web experiences for [local news media](https://www.tintaborneo.com/), for [local gov](https://mpp.kotimkab.go.id/), and more.

My focus to build simple, fast websites that gets the job done. I worked together with a team of local engineers, not only to bring good digital experiences to life, but also contributing for advancements in our society. I enjoy tinkering with bleeding-edge technologies, e.g using Astro in production even before it hits version 1.0.

Away from my computer, I am involved in social volunteering and youth organizations, among them is at Karang Taruna of Kab. Kotawaringin Timur, at Indonesian National Youth Council (KNPI) of Kalimantan Tengah, and current leader of [KAMMI](https://kammi.id/) Central Kalimantan.
